OutlookAutoRules
================

Forked version of dcorns project, which is upgraded to VS2015 using the Ribon style of addin allowing it to work with Outlook 2013 and above. This simplified project includes only one outlook addin, allowing you to add a user (via selecting them and right clicking) and add them to a preexisting rule.

You can download and use the visual studio sln to open in visula studio.

Tested in outlook 2013.
